The [vite-react-starter](https://github.com/rajtslegr/vite-react-starter) repository on GitHub is a simple starting point for building a Vite and React application and it provides a basic setup for frontend development.

## Vite
Vite is a fast frontend build tool that prioritizes quick rebuild times and efficient code splitting. During development, you can take advantage of Vite's customizable features for a smooth experience.

## React
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM to create dynamic and complex UIs efficiently. This repository includes React, so you can start building your application right away.

## TypeScript
TypeScript is a statically typed version of JavaScript that offers type checking at compile time and extra features not available in JavaScript. It's a good choice for large-scale projects.

## Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly add styles to your application using pre-designed utility classes without writing custom CSS. This repository includes Tailwind CSS.

## ESLint and Prettier
ESLint and Prettier are tools that maintain code consistency and quality. ESLint checks your code for potential issues, while Prettier ensures a consistent code style. Both are integrated into this repository.

## Husky and lint-staged
Husky and lint-staged ensure code quality before committing. Husky is a Git hook manager that runs scripts before committing, and lint-staged lints and formats only the staged files.

## Vitest and React Testing Library
Vitest and React Testing Library are tools for testing your application. Vitest is alternative to popular testing framework Jest, while React Testing Library tests React components and hooks. This repository includes both, so you can easily write tests for your application.

## Playwright
Playwright is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It allows you to write tests that simulate real user interactions, making it a useful tool for testing the full flow of your application.

## pnpm
pnpm is a disk-space efficient package manager for Node.js. It uses hard links and symlinks to save disk space instead of storing multiple copies of the same package. This repository uses pnpm.

## Getting Started
Getting started with this repository is easy. Clone it to your local machine, install the dependencies with pnpm, and start developing.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rajtslegr/vite-react-starter.git
$ cd vite-react-starter
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run dev
```

With these steps, you'll have a basic setup for your next Vite + React project.
